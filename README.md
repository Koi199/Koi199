Hello, I am Kyle aka Koi199
I uploaded my most successful 3D models and pieces of code on here. 
I am currently messing around with data visualization in Python and Arduino microcontrollers. 
Let me know if you want to collaborate on anything --> kyleahvon@gmail.com
Always down to do a Hackathon too :)
